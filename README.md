## What is calculator?
A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. Basic calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication and division mathematical calculations.

## Usage
To perform operations on numbers, you must enter the first number (first operand), find the arithmetic operation and enter the second number (second operand).

Entering the digit of the highest operand begins with the rightmost digit and follows the rules for working with a digital display and scoreboard.

To perform arithmetic operations, you must enter the first operation, enter the sign of the arithmetic operation, enter the second operation and use the opportunity to get the result or continue execution, identify the sign of the arithmetic operation to continue calculations.
